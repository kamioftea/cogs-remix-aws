After rolling to choose sides, place an objective in
the centre of the board.

Then each player takes it in turn to place two zero-point
bluff counters, a one-point bluff counter, and
a two-point bluff counter face down in their
opponentâ€™s half of the board. Roll off to see who
places the first bluff counter. Bluff counters are
treated like objectives.

At the end of the third round, turn all of the bluff
counters face up.
