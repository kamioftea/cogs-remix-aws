You will need a 1995 point Kings of War army. This should be built using

The optional rules for Allies **CAN** be used.

You can submit your list on the <a href="/event/cogs-of-war/edit-details">

[email a pdf of your list to jeff@goblinoid.co.uk](
mailto:jeff@goblinoid.co.uk). Your list should be submitted by 23:59 on 
Sunday 16th April.

Players will receive +3 tournament points if they submit on time. This 
will reduce by one point per day or part-day since the submission time 
that has passed before the list is received, to a minimum of 0 if it is three
or more days late.

Part of the joy of wargaming is the spectacle of two armies clashing on the
table-top. Please bring a fully painted and based army that fits with 
the fantasy wargaming aesthetic. However, we will not penalise players if
they have a good reason they can’t – no questions asked.

It should be clear to your opponent what each unit in your army 
represents.

Steve Pearson is our spare player. In the event that we have an odd number of 
attendees, he'll use this list.

The event will be using the rules in the 3.5 edition core rulebook, 
along with any FAQ or errata published by Mantic Games prior to the 
event.

The optional withdraw rule will NOT be in play.

Chess clocks will be used to help the tournament run on schedule. Clocks
should be used throughout deployment, scout moves, and player turns.
 
If you and your opponent disagree on a rule, pause the clock whilst you 
check the rulebook. If that doesn’t resolve your issue, please ask the 
tournament organiser to adjudicate.

The clock should also be paused if either player needs to take a break 
for any reason.

If a player times out whilst resolving an attack, they may finish 
resolving that attack, and any pending nerve checks. After those are 
done, the timed out player may not roll any more dice and can only issue
change facing orders during any remaining movement phases. Please ensure 
to complete these moves quickly.

If there are enough pauses during a game that you predict the round time
will end before both players have finished, please inform the tournament

both players.`),

We will be using scenarios based on the [balanced scenarios developed by

There will be one scenario based on controlling objective markers, one 
based on holding loot tokens, and one based on controlling areas of the 
battlefield.

Full details of the scenario to be played and how to score victory 
points will be provided at the start of each round.

There will be up to 7 victory points available for each scenario, with 
at most 3 points scored if you draw or lose. These will also count as 
tournament points (TPs).

You get 3 bonus tournament points if you win the scenario, 1 bonus point
if you draw.

You get up to three bonus tournament points based on the total points of
enemy units you routed during the game.
 
| Total points routed | Bonus TPs |
| ------------------- | --------- |
|  500+               | +1        |
| 1100+               | +2        |
| 1695+               | +3        |

leave your army on display over lunch so that everyone has a chance to 
decide who to vote for.

Players will be able to cast votes for their most sporting opponent when 
they submit their final scores. The player with the most votes will win the

change facing orders during any remaining movement phases. Please ensure

There will be one scenario based on controlling objective markers, one 
based on holding loot tokens, and one based on controlling areas of the

Full details of the scenario to be played and how to score victory 
points will be provided at the start of each round.

There will be up to seven victory points available for each scenario, with 
at most three points scored if you draw or lose. These will also count as 
tournament points (TPs).

You get five bonus tournament points if you win the scenario, two bonus points
if you draw.

You get up to three bonus tournament points based on the total points of
enemy units you routed during the game.

You will need a 1995 point Kings of War army.  This should be built using the standard army 
selection and composition rules in the 3.5 edition core rulebook with the updates in Clash of Kings 
2025.

### Optional rules 

* Allies **MAY** be used
* Command dice will **NOT** be used
* Withdraw rule will **NOT** be in play. 

You can submit your list on the <a href="/event/cogs-of-war-2025/edit-details">
edit details page</a>. Alternatively 
[email a pdf of your list to jeff@goblinoid.co.uk](
mailto:jeff@goblinoid.co.uk). Your list should be submitted by 23:59 on 
Sunday 30th March.

Players will receive +3 tournament points if they submit on time. This 
will reduce by one point per day or part-day since the submission time 
that has passed before the list is received, to a minimum of 0 if it is three
or more days late.

Part of the joy of wargaming is the spectacle of two armies clashing on the table-top. We would 
prefer players to bring a fully painted and based army that fits with the fantasy wargaming 
aesthetic.

It should be clear to your opponent what each unit in your army represents.

You will need a 1000 point Kings of War army. This should be built using
the standard army selection and composition rules in the Kings of War version 
3.5 compendium, the rules updates in Clash of Kings 2025, and the rules from
Clash of Kings 2024 that were not reprinted (e.g. the updated Twilight Kin 
army list.)

### Optional rules 

* Allies **MAY** be used
* Command dice will **NOT** be used
* Withdraw rule will **NOT** be in play. 

You can submit your list on the <a href="/event/clockwork-2025/edit-details">
edit details page</a>. Alternatively 
[email a pdf of your list to jeff@goblinoid.co.uk](
mailto:jeff@goblinoid.co.uk). Your list should be submitted by 23:59 on 
Sunday 9th November.

Players will receive +3 tournament points if they submit on time. This 
will reduce by one point per day or part-day since the submission time 
that has passed before the list is received, to a minimum of 0 if it is three
or more days late.

Part of the joy of wargaming is the spectacle of two armies clashing on the
table-top. Please bring a fully painted and based army that fits with 
the fantasy wargaming aesthetic. However, we will not penalise players if
they have a good reason they can’t – no questions asked.

It should be clear to your opponent what each unit in your army 
represents.

Steve Pearson is our spare player, in the event of an odd number of players 
he'll use this list:

The event will be using the rules in Kings of War version 3.5 compendium, the
rules updates in Clash of Kings 2025, and the rules from Clash of Kings 2024
that were not reprinted (e.g. the updated Twilight Kin army list.)

Chess clocks will be used to help the tournament run on schedule. Clocks
should be used throughout deployment, scout moves, and player turns.
 
If you and your opponent disagree on a rule, pause the clock whilst you 
check the rulebook. If that doesn’t resolve your issue, please ask the 
tournament organiser to adjudicate.

The clock should also be paused if either player needs to take a break 
for any reason.

Unlike Cogs of War tournaments, timing out is strictly dice down. If you run out
of time on the clock, you must instantly stop play. If you are currently 
rolling a combat or shooting attack, no wounds are applied from the attack and
the target is steady.

If there are enough pauses during a game that you predict the round time
will end before both players have finished, please inform the tournament 
organiser as soon as possible so that this can be resolved fairly for 
both players.`),

We will be using scenarios based on the [balanced scenarios developed by 
the Shroud of the Reaper tournament organisers](
https://www.shroudofthereaper.co.uk/balanced-scenarios).

Full details of the scenario to be played and how to score victory 
points will be provided at the start of each round.

There will be up to 7 victory points available for each scenario, with 
at most 3 points scored if you draw or lose. These will also count as 
tournament points (TPs).

You get 5 bonus tournament points if you win the scenario, 2 bonus points
if you draw.

You get up to three bonus tournament points based on the total points of
enemy units you routed during the game.
 
| Total points routed | Bonus TPs |
| ------------------- | --------- |
|  250+               | +1        |
|  550+               | +2        |
|  850+               | +3        |

Players will therefore score up to fifteen tournament points per round.

score is 78.`),

Trophies will be awarded for first, second, and third places. There will

Players will be able to cast votes for their favourite armies. The 
army with the most votes will win the best army award, with the 
tournament organiser having a deciding vote in the case of a tie. Please 
leave your army on display over lunch so that everyone has a chance to 
decide who to vote for.

Players will be able to cast votes for their most sporting opponent when 
they submit their final scores. The player with the most votes will win the 
most sporting award. Ties will be broken in the favour of the player 
with the lower ranking in the tournament scores.

For both categories, players will receive seven total votes they can
