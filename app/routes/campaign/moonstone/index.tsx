        Starting January 2025 Chesterfield Open Gaming Society will be running a
        Moonstone gaming evening and escalation campaign on the 2nd Monday of
        each month.
      </p>
      <p>
        Participants will pick a faction and a starting roster of models that
        will grow as the campaign progresses. We will gradually introduce
        Moonstone campaign mechanics such as upgrades and machination points
        later in the campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
        From February onwards, Moonstones collected will be recorded as victory
        points and used to rank players in the campaign. Once campaign cards and
        machination points are introduced in April, these will affect victory
        points earned as per the Arising campaign rules.
      </p>

      <h3>Notes</h3>
      <p>
        The game size increasing to 6 in May and June will be reviewed based on
        how long March's and April's games take to play.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where the roster is larger than the game size, you pick the models to
        use as you deploy them, as per Moonstone organised play rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        As well as adding one new model each month, you may optionally swap an
        existing model in your roster for another each month.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can follow the{" "}

        </a>{" "}
        for updates.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will decide in June if the campaign will be continued, or a new one
        started for July onwards.
      </p>
      <h2>Taking part</h2>
      <p>
        If you want to take part, please see Jeff in person at a club night, or
        email: <a href="mailto:jeff@goblinoid.co.uk">jeff@goblinoid.co.uk</a>.
        Please include your name, chosen faction, and starting roster. As
        January is for friendly games, the rosters can be submitted any time
        before 6pm on Sunday 9th February. After then, please submit added
        models by 6pm the day before the campaign evening.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want this campaign to be accessible as possible. Whilst you are
        encouraged to use the official Moonstone models, this is by no means
        required. You can use proxies or standees as long as it is clear to your
        opponent which model is which. Please make sure you also bring the
        relevant stat cards for the models in your roster. These can be
        downloaded from{" "}
        <a href="https://www.moonstonethegame.com/downloads">
          the Moonstone downloads page
        </a>{" "}
        or there is a{" "}
        <a href="https://app.moontome.com/Compendium">
          card compendium app, Moontome
        </a>
        . If you will struggle to print these, please let me know and I we can
        print them and bring them along to the campaign evening.
      </p>
      <p>
        A number of club members also have spare models they are not using in
        the campaign. Please ask on the campaigns facebook events if there are
        models you would be interested in borrowing.
